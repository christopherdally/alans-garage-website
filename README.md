To design a website for a local garage that currently hasn't got any online presence at the moment with the following;

•	Contact Page with form (with google maps added to page)
•	Reviews (if possible, from Google Reviews)
•   	Create a request an estimate website form
•	Contact Details
•	Social Links on the page (use Font Awesome for icons)
•	Use bootstrap for the navigation menu 

References

Used Font Awesome v4 for icons on the page as couldn't use the most recent one as need to pay for an account.

Used Colorhunt.co website to generate a colour scheme for the website https://colorhunt.co/palette/0a26471442722052952c74b3.

rgb(10, 38, 71)	rgb(20, 66, 114)			rgb(32, 82, 149)		rgb(44, 116, 179)

All the images for the site have been sourced from Adobe Stock Free (used on the header and services section)

Bootstrap Framework V5 for navigation menu

Used Sociable Kit (https://www.sociablekit.com/) to embed Google reviews on the site

Issues

7th March 2023 - 

1. Bootstrap Menu not loading figured out that I didn't paste Javascript onto the page hence why it wasn't working
2. Most of the site is now designed just need to configure smaller screen sizes 

8th March 2023 -

1. Add the phone number and address to the top of the page below the navigation
2. Design the site to be responsive as services and contact details weren't right
3. Decided to go with separate services pages for the following (Vehicle Servicing, Tyres, MOT's and Vehicle Repairs) as I believe this would be better for the SEO scores of the end website.
