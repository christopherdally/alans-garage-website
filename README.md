Christopher Dally - Web Development Milestone Project 1

Project Purpose

To design a website for a local garage that currently hasn't got any online presence at the moment with the following;

•	Contact Page with form (with google maps added to page)
•	Reviews (if possible, from Google Reviews)
•   	Create a request an estimate website form
•	Contact Details
•	Social Links on the page (use Font Awesome for icons)
•	Use bootstrap for the navigation menu 

References

Used Font Awesome v4 for icons on the page as couldn't use the most recent one as need to pay for an account.

Used Colorhunt.co website to generate a colour scheme for the website https://colorhunt.co/palette/0a26471442722052952c74b3.
#0A2647 			#144272 			#205295 			#2C74B3
rgb(10, 38, 71)	rgb(20, 66, 114)			rgb(32, 82, 149)		rgb(44, 116, 179)

All the images for the site have been sourced from Adobe Stock Free (used on the header and services section)

Bootstrap Framework V5 for navigation menu

Used Sociable Kit (https://www.sociablekit.com/) to embed Google reviews on the site

Embedded Google Maps to Contact Page

Issues/Changes 

7th March 2023 - 

1. Bootstrap Menu not loading figured out that I didn't paste Javascript onto the page hence why it wasn't working
2. Most of the site is now designed just need to configure smaller screen sizes 

8th March 2023 -

1. Add the phone number and address to the top of the page below the navigation
2. Design the site to be responsive as services and contact details weren't right
3. Decided to go with separate services pages for the following (Vehicle Servicing, Tyres, MOT's and Vehicle Repairs) as I believe this would be better for the SEO scores.
4. Add meta keywords and descriptions to all pages again this is for a better SEO.
5. Deployed website via git on my server run by Plesk for testing purposes at https://musing-archimedes.109-228-60-76.plesk.page/.
6. Run CSS Validator - All clear apart from font awesome
7. Run HTML Validator
	1. Change the header image section to a div instead of a section
	2. Removed height and width of the iframe (reviews)
8. Added id to iframe reviews to ensure the website passes HTML Validator
9. Added Vehicle Servicing Page
10. Added Contact Us page
11. Embedded Google Maps to Website Contact Page
12. Changed styling on the contact page button as the mobile version wasn't showing the full button name
13. Created the remainder of the site pages
14. Minor changes
	1. Vosa icon on the bottom of every page
	2. Active page in Nav bar update

10th March 2023 -

1. Changed the default bootstrap navbar background color and link to better suit the site.
