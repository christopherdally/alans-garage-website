Christopher Dally - Web Development Milestone Project 1

Project Purpose

To design a website for a local garage that currently hasn't got any online presence at the moment with the following;

•	Booking Form for MOT (Create a Page)
•	Contact Page with form
•	Reviews (if possible, from Google Reviews)
•	Contact Details
•	Social Links on the page (use Font Awesome for icons)
•	Use bootstrap for the navigation menu 

References

Used Font Awesome v4 for icons on the page as couldn't use the most recent one as need to pay for an account.

Used Colorhunt.co website to generate a colour scheme for the website https://colorhunt.co/palette/0a26471442722052952c74b3.

Header images for website sourced from Adobe Stock Free

Bootstrap Framework V5 for navigation menu

Used Sociable Kit (https://www.sociablekit.com/) to embed Google reviews on the site

Issues

7th March 2023 - 

1. Bootstrap Menu not loading figured out that I didn't paste Javascript onto the page hence why it wasn't working

2. Most of the site is now designed just need to configure smaller screen sizes
