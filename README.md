## Testing 

All features on the site were tested to ensure the responsiveness of the site across all devices. Contact form transfer to thank you page to tell customers of the message sent. Reviews on the home page tell users of how the garage performs with customers.

Site was deployed to git pages for more testing found that the overflow of page so ammended the div spacing to sort this out.


## Issues/Changes
